## About the project
There is a lack of a single platform that provides comprehensive information for popular travel destinations. Travellers have to often switch among different applications, requiring multiple registration processes, identity verifications and bank account details filling. This combination increases the cost of time, brings huge inconvenience and unnecessary burden to their devices.

We want to build a platform that can serve as a central place for all information on an area within a city, hence creating a strong tool for travellers to choose where to stay based on their individual preferences. Information on this platform currently include airbnb, Wifi and hotspots, top attractions, restaurants, crime rates, motor vehicle accidents and subway stations. We can then add other content based on the userâ€™s experience and needs.

We are limiting this project to the city of New York, due to its size, differentiation of areas, and data availability. The project would then be able to scale to other areas based on available information or data.
